    Font Awesome<br />
    ####<br />
    Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for<br />
    commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.<br />
    Full Font Awesome Free license: https://fontawesome.com/license.</p>

<p># Icons: CC BY 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)<br />
    In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons<br />
    packaged as SVG and JS file types.</p>

<p># Fonts: SIL OFL 1.1 License (https://scripts.sil.org/OFL)<br />
    In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons<br />
    packaged as web and desktop font files.</p>

<p># Code: MIT License (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)<br />
    In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.</p>

<p># Attribution<br />
    Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font<br />
    Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient<br />
    attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these<br />
    files normally.</p>

<p>We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work<br />
    to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to <br />
    learn about Font Awesome.</p>

<p># Brand Icons<br />
    All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners. The use of these<br />
    trademarks does not indicate endorsement of the trademark holder by Font<br />
    Awesome, nor vice versa. **Please do not use brand logos for any purpose except<br />
    to represent the company, product, or service to which they refer.**<br />
