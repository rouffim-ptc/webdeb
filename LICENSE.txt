commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.
Full Font Awesome Free license: https://fontawesome.com/license.

# Icons: CC BY 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons
packaged as SVG and JS file types.

# Fonts: SIL OFL 1.1 License (https://scripts.sil.org/OFL)
In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons
packaged as web and desktop font files.

In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.

# Attribution
Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font

files normally.

We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to 
learn about Font Awesome.
